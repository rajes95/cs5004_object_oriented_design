 * This program serves as a simple calculator. It keeps track of a single number

 * 
 * Each cycle allows the user to repeatedly add, subtract, multiply, or divide
 * by a second number.
 * 
 * If the user enters any operator symbol other than +, âˆ’, *, or /, then an
 * UnknownOperatorException is thrown and the user is asked to reenter that line
 * of input.
